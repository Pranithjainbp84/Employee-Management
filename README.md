# Employee-Management

 In this project, I have created an Employee Record Management System using Core Java and JDBC. The system
            will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Employee records, including
            adding new Employee, viewing Employee, updating Employee information, and deleting Employee records from
            the system.
